   But by 4 PM, I saw my credit bill and anxiety spiked. My heart raced for 20 minutes. 
    Later, chatting with my wife calmed me down, while scrolling Instagram made things worse."""

sample_text_2 = """Ugh today was... I don't even know. Woke up at 11 because why not, skipped breakfast again. 
The meeting with Sarah was fine I guess but then Mark said that thing about my presentation 
and I just - you know? Walked out to get coffee, tripped on the stairs (classic), spilled 
it everywhere. Called mom but she was busy with her book club. 
Later at the gym, some guy kept staring at me while I was on the treadmill which was weird 
but also kinda flattering? Ate a whole pizza watching Netflix. Now it's 3am and I'm wondering 
why I can't sleep even though I'm exhausted. Tomorrow's another day I suppose. PS: My knee hurts 
from the fall but whatever."""
